To check what pins are currently muxed to, check:
/sys/kernel/debug/omap_mux/ stuff

You can adjust them with, for instance:
echo '7' > /sys/kernel/debug/omap_mux/gpmc_ad6
which sets pin P8_3 to mode 7. See
http://www.gigamegablog.com/2012/01/05/beaglebone-coding-101-blinking-an-led/
for more details about working out what the mux ID is for a given point on the
connector..


Note that if you echo '7', you set the pin to GPIO output.
To use it for input (with a pull-up resistor enabled), echo '37'.
To use it for input (with a pull-up disabled), echo '27'.

This was taken from the Beaglebone google group:

> Also, I believe input pullup is actually 0x37 (AM33XX_INPUT_EN |
> AM3XX_PULL_UP) and pulldown is 0x27 (if the above is true). I tested

Take a look at the manual referenced above...

bit 5:        input enable
bit 4:        pull up type selection
bit 3:        pull up/down enable
bits 0-2:   mode selection

By the way, I think there is a mistake in table 9-1 bit 3. The pull up/
down enable is reversed. According to the follow up details in section
9.2.2 and specifically table 9.3, bit 3 value of 0 is disable and 1 is
enable. I plan on sending a note to TI on that and get clarification...
