There are several JVMs available:
 * Zero - interpreter only, possibly JIT in recent releases.
 * JamVM - seems to be the best bet for Arm. Fastest, small memory footprint.
 * Cacao - is a full-featured JIT JVM

You can install all of them at once in Ubuntu, and then select between them
like so:
 java -jamvm -version
 java -zero -version
 java -cacao -version

The default is specified in /usr/lib/jvm/.../lib/arm/jvm.cfg

There is a bug with JamVM, such that it won't work until you cd into the
above arm/lib/ directory and do:
 ln -s jamvm/libjvm.so .




There was some info here, but it was for Angstrom and I ignored it:
